# Real-time Object Tracking


This is an interactive web application that uses your device's camera to detect and track objects in real-time. Built with p5.js for visual processing and ml5.js (which is powered by TensorFlow.js) for object detection (using the COCO-SSD model), it allows you to visualize the trajectories of detected objects.
